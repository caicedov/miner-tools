# Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an innovative tool for visualizing and analyzing mining data, specifically designed to enhance decision-making processes for mining operations. This tool will leverage modern visualization techniques and statistical analysis to present complex geological data in an accessible and informative manner.

## Building Blocks

This project utilizes React as the front end user interface, and Rust on the back end.

The React front end is built on top of an excellent template coded by <a href="https://www.creative-tim.com">Creative Tim</a>, but only utilizes a fraction of the capabilities that the original template included...mainly because it wasn't needed for this particular application.
